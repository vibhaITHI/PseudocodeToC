# PseudocodeToC

Given an algorithm, output an auto generated C Code
      GrammarBasedApproach - Making use of Lex to tokenize and Yacc to specify the grammar to convert it to corresponding C Code and its symbol table

The code aims to convert a pseudo code given by the user to a working C code
           
*  Input: The algorithm is given by the user in a predefined format.


*   Output: The output will be the symbol table and the c code for the input pseudocode.
